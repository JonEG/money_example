# TODO LIST

## Description
We'll make a to-do list to remind us what we need to do, to keep us focused, and to tell us
when we are finished. When we start working on an item, we'll make it bold, __like this__. When
we finish an item, we'll cross it off, <s>like this</s>. When we think of another test to write, we'll add
it to the list.
